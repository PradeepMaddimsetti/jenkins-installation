the possition of the different components on the microprocessor
is varied 
we have to examined and find the hot sports on the processor
this are arised during the device operation

the heat dissipation in the microprocessor is temporarlly 
non uniform
due to this it may cause high thermal gradeients and generates 
thermal stresses
