Abstract
* The placement and arrangement of the different components on a microprocessor chip is examinated to make less severe the hotspots 
 that my arise on device during its operation

* the power dissipation of the individual components on a microprocessor is non uniform due to this resulting in high  thermal gradient 
and a consequences high thermal stresses

* variations of power dissipation rises in the microprocessor develops large thermal gradient localized hotspots 
 these hotspots can cause device failure and a loss in performance that results when the clock ferquency slows with voltage variations
 this is due to inclusion of heat
* to minimize the thermal gradient in the device by developing a new architechural design that redistributing some of the components in 
the device
in architechural poin of view few components are constained that cannot  be seperated due to performance decreases
and few are allow rearranged

* the repositionable components on the device changes the power dissipation which causes variation in thermal gradient
* a computational model is developed to compare the heat dissipation on microprocessor by repositioning the compenent on the device
to find out the best floor plan of the microprocessor
