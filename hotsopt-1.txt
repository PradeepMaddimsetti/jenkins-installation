the placement and arrangement of the different components on a 
micro processor chip is examined to matigate the hotspots that
may arisea on the device during its operation

the power dissipation in the microprocessor is spatially and 
temporarlly non uniform

due to this possible resulting in high thermalgradeients and 
a consequence hieh thermal stresses

these hotspots arises because the powerdisscipated by some components
accounting for a major fraction of the total power of the device

the device then devlops large temperature gradeients
and localized hot sports these hot spots can cause device failures
and a loss in performance that results when clock frequence is 
slow down with voltage is slicing 
it also leads to low yield
